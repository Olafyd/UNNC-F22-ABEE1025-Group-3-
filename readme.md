While simulating it keep on reporting 
No such file or directory: './simulation_output/0.25_1.0/eplusout.csv'
we didn't figure it out after checking.

as a result we failed to run the result,but with OOP, parametric simulation logic,
and empty document with corresponding name on it

It can take any two arbitrary simulation model parameters and their ranges 
it have a reasonable OOP design, with use of class attributes, methods, getters and setters.
